# mxTune - a music mod for minecraft forge


This mod adds musical instruments that allow you to play music in MML format. This is a format already used in some popular online games so there are many tunes available or you can create your own. You can play solo or in groups of up to eight players.

This is currently in development and is not recommended for modpacks at this time.
