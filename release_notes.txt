2021-01-16 mxtune-1.12.2-1.0.1
First Release Version and fix for a rare null pointer exception.
 * Fix rare NPE in PCMCodec.class.

----
2020-12-03 mxtune-1.12.2-1.0.0-rc.3
Fixes:
 * Fix a major issue where invalid MML can cause an infinite loop causing the client to freeze.

----
2020-12-01 mxtune-1.12.2-1.0.0-rc.2
Changes:
 * Added a ful-bright emissive light effect to the Band Amp when it plays music.

Fixes:
 * (Oops :P) I fixed the MML paste from clipboard button that I broke when I was replacing the MML parser. Sorry everyone.

----
2020-11-14 mxtune-1.12.2-1.0.0-rc.1
Changes:
 * Removed the ANTLR based MML Parser. The new parser does not generate errors for badly written MML.
   Because of this all of the parse error related text boxes have been removed from the MXT GUI. This
   reduces the size of the final jar by about 1MB since the ANTLR runtime jar is no longer used.
 * MML: Enable the Maple Story 2 sustain command. 's1' to turn and or 's0' to turn off.
 * Timpani of Doom: jump particle effect is now white in snowy biomes else brown.
Fixes:
 * Web links in the MXT GUI work again.

----
2020-10-25 mxtune-1.12.2-0.8.0-beta.10
NOTE: Backup your WORLDS before updating to this version. Instruments have changed.
 * This means you will need to open the inventory on your hand-held instruments and select the timbre.
Changes:
 * Band Amp - Change Sneak-RIGHT-Click behavior depending on lock state. Update hoover helps.
 * All hand-held instruments are now ALL-IN-ONE Multi-Instruments.
 * Added "Gold Bone" and "Timpanic Membrane" ingredients and updated recipes and advancements
 * Added "Golden Skeleton" and "Timpani of Doom" mobs that can drop the above ingredients and sometimes sheet music.
 * The rare ingredients are also available from the musician villager.
 * Advancements and Recipes have been changed, but I'm not finished. Expect more changes.
 * Importing MML Improvements
   * 3MLE .mml files: Improved program/instrument mapping to mxTune instruments.
   * Maple Story 2 / Musical Nexus ZIPPED ms2mml part files: Part names now map to mxTune instruments. e.g.:
       p1-pickbassguitar.out.ms2mml
       p2-cello.out.ms2mml
       p3-harpsichord.out.ms2mml
       p4-piano.out.ms2mml
       p5-tomtom.out.ms2mml
       p6-violin.out.ms2mml

Internal:
 * MML - Instruments are now passed as the SoundFontProxy ID (int). This allows for handling the Mabinogi
         drum kit using a note re-mapper instead of making a custom soundfont instrument.

----
2019-09-01 mxtune-1.12.2-0.7.0-beta.6

Fixes:
 * CF #19: Client Crash - CME- mxtune.util.MXTuneRuntimeException: java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
   Added a synchronized block around the ModelLoaderRegistry#getModel method call in the spinet piano renderer.

Additions:
 * Add a title field to the PlayList class record. Update the playlist
   management GUI to allow adding/editing/saving the title. Update the
   ClientPlayManager class to display the playlist title as an onscreen
   notification when the player enters a chunk (chunk playlist change).

----
2019-06-11 mxtune-1.12.2-0.7.0-beta.5

Fixes:
 * GitHub #1: Crash when Mechanical User tries to trade with Player
   Corrected logic in the GroupManager EntityInteract event. If this does not solve the issue, then I also added a
   General Config Option "Disable JAM Party Right Click" to prevent the event from firing. This also  disables the
   JAM/Party management gui that is tied by default to the "J" key-bind. This disables multi-player music.

Changes:
 * Added client side config options to disable vanilla background music.

 * The "Music Paper" gui for pasting MML has some new features. It can now import 3MLE .mml files. A Huge Thank You
   to たんらる (https://twitter.com/fourthline) for allowing me to use the 3MLE reader code from fourthline/mmlTools.
   If the .mml file contains multiple instrument parts, i.e. 2-n person JAMS then it will attempt create a tab for
   each part. Ideally the Tracks Groups features was used when configuring the tracks in 3MLE.

   In addition is can also import Maple Story 2 .ms2mml and .zip (zipped ms2mml multi-part tunes) see:
     https://musicalnexus.net/maplebeats-solos/
     https://musicalnexus.net/maplebeats-2-person-ensemble/
     etc.

   The gui allows saving the MML pastes and imports to a new file format used by mxTune with the extension .mxt.
   These files are stored on the client. The location of the import and save folders can be found by using the
   "Import" and "Open" buttons, then using the "Open Folder" button on file selector gui's. The actual location is
   relative to the instance of the minecraft run folder: e.g.
     %appdata%/.minecraft/mxtune/import
     <mc run folder>/mxtune/library
   If you make a lots of .mxt files you will probably want to back them up for re-use.
   Making sheet music for JAMS is now easier than ever! The new gui will create a piece of sheet music for each
   part/instrument when you click the *Write* button.

   The gui supports up to 10 parts/instruments. One per tab. Each part can have up to 10 tracks: Melody + 9 chord lines.

   The big MML paste box is gone. There are now two buttons. One for pasting the clipboard contents into the part,
   and the other to copy the part to the clipboard. Just the basics. The MML now shows up with each track in it's own
   text box. There can be up to 10 tracks. Melody + 9 chord.

   Please note this is new and somewhat experimental. It is intended to make importing MML info mxTune easier. It is
   not intended for use as a MML editor. Use 3MLE or other tools for that please.

   Notes:
     * The "Title" becomes the filename when you save.
     * You can't save if the title is empty!
     * You can't save/play invalid MML you will have to fix it.
     * The parse error list remains a "feature" for now until I rewrite the MML parser. The parser has been improved
       but will still find plenty of tunes with stupid MML like tied rests (Face palm), missing arguments etc. Clicking
       or double clicking on the error will place the cursor near the error in the track.

New Experimental Super Secret Stuff: (MML based Background Music)
 * A new item called the "Staff of Music". Read the item hoover text. When in the Play list Manager gui hold down
   the SHIFT key and mouse over the list boxes for more help. I'm not going to write more about using it here. If you
   are curious DM "Aeronica / Rymor#6970" on the Forge, MMD, "Mod Dev Cafe", or "Faerun Heroes" Discord servers.

 * A new command "/mxTuneServerUpdateAllowed <player name> <true|false>" that enables the "Staff of Music" to:
     1) Upload mxt files to the server "Manage Music" and
     2) Create play lists and apply them to either the WORLD (Dimension), or a CHUNK

 * A new item called "Gui Test" - opens an client side mxt file manager. Similar to the new "Sheet Music" gui. It
   is what it is, just an item use to open that gui for testing.

 * To hear it in use (When the 1.12.2 demo server is up) visit Faerun Heroes - MMORPG

Additions:
 * New block: Band Amp - Lets you play multi-instrument MML Music.
   Place the music into the instruments and add them to the Band Amp inventory. It's redstone and hopper friendly.
   Use these features to automate playing tunes in sequence using mine carts, etc. That's right it's a low tier
   musical automata. There are 12 slots. Yes you can now play Maple Story 2 MML 10 part, 10 piece JAMS, though you
   are stuck with current Mabinogi compatible instruments at the moment. The existing Orchestra and Standard
   percussion sets can be used in place of the MS2 Timpani and Tom Toms respectively.
   *** This is very much an experimental addition and suggestions are welcome ***

 * Hand held Piano. It's intended to be used in the Band Amp.

Changes:
 * The sheet music format changed. Added a song duration field (automatically calculated). Allows improved server
   managed play management.
 * Add buttons to the hand held instrument inventory GUIs to open the Music Options and HUD placement dialogs.
 * Starting and stopping instruments is more reliable now. No more clicks and pops when force stopping a play session.

Fixes:
 * De-Wonkify the Music HUD adjustment screen.
 * A lot of backend code cleanup and improvements:
      https://sonarcloud.io/project/activity?id=net.aeronica.mods.mxtune%3AmxTune%3A1.12

 * For MAP MAKERS: Per Chunk/Area MML based background music system
 * Improved advancements
 * More Musical Automata
 * A personal MML player - i.e. tune lists, shuffle, etc.
 * Music Themed MOBS and recipe changes for instruments that use common and rare drops.

2017-07-27: mxtune-1.11.2-0.4.0-dev.25
Fixes:
Issue #2 Extraneous input '&' after note length command: Now allows the tie of a tied note to exist before or after an interspersed command e.g. "c.&c16l64&c" or "c.&c16&l64c" 
Issue #17 "Musician Villager Entity Name": Added language key for the Musician Villager.
Issue #18 "Suggestion; MML@ & final ;": 
    Add a URL link to the "MML Simple Editor" dialog. URL is configurable. default URL is https://mabibeats.com/
    The "MML@" and ";" tokens in the MML entry dialog is now optional.

Changes:
Improved ArcheAge MML support. Now detects ArcheAge MML volume levels and "does the right thing".
Improved MML parsing by making it less strict. It will allow silly MML like accidentals on rests: e.g. "a&a&R+8.l16a" The "MML@" and ";" tokens in the MML entry dialog is optional. Allow rests in between tied notes. Rests will extend overall length of the tied as expected.
Added more localization string for GUIs.
Improved tool-tips on instruments and music paper.

Breakage:
Updated to latest the MCP mappings and in the process I broke placement of the piano. I did fix it, but if a piano looks weird break it and replace it. Sheet Music that may have been on on the piano is lost forever. Sorry.

Issue #16 "Crash on Music & Sounds Menu"; Remove the problematic ModSoundCategory class. It was a nice idea, but ultimately enums and reflection is a dicey thing. Especially in the world of Forge and Minecraft modding.

Changes:
The mxTune volume control has been removed from the vanilla "Music & Sounds" options menu. mxTune now uses the Players volume control.

2017-03-28: mxtune-1.10.2-0.4.0-dev.20, mxtune-1.11.2-0.4.0-dev.20
Note:
This release intended primarily to get feedback about the new soundfont and instruments.
Changes:
Added a soundfont (assets/mxtune/synth/mxtune.sf2). Now music on all clients will have same instruments/timbre. The soundfont is
modeled on Mabinogi instruments. This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS! This is NOT the final version of the soundfont.
Soundfont Goals:
1) Make the instruments sound as good as those in Mabinogi, but a little different.
2) Keep it small. It's currently about 10MB.
3) Add some additional instruments. For now harpsicord, coupled harpsicord, recorder, trumpet, standard percussion set, and orchestral percussion set.

Due to instrument changes, you are stuck with my cheap textures and limited json models. Some instruments like the harpsicord, cello,
and percussion sets will eventually become block instruments. That is they will need to be placed into the world to be used. Similar
to the piano. Recipes changed and updated to reflect the new soundfont.

Fixes:
Small improvements to starting and stopping play. Tunes should not stop in the middle of play anymore. Still more work to be done. I'm
aware of some threading and network data synchronization issues. Sections of code to be re-written.

Piano was dropping it's item in creative mode when broken. This has been corrected, but you will need break and re-place all pianos in
the world. Any enclosed sheet music is gone forever. Sorry, it had to be done.

Added support to the build for Travis CI and SonarCube. As a result many bugs and security vulnerabilities have been squashed.

2017-02-20: mxtune-1.10.2-0.3.1.0-dev.19, mxtune-1.11.2-0.3.1.0-dev.19
Changes:
Turn off logging for the SoundSystem endOfStream events. On some systems this was causing the fml-client-latest logs to grow very large.
Troubleshoot and make some change to the ClientAudio classes thread use, and use of the synchronized specifier.
Poached ConfigureSound from Dynamic Surroundings and added configuration options for it. This allows using all of the available sound channels.

Add an instanceof check for IInstrument to the SheetMusicUtil#getSheetMusic method to ensure it does not try to open a non-existent inventory.

Issue #1: [Minor Tweak] Music Paper should use dyeBlack oredict in its recipe.
Replaced the shapeless recipe with a shaped recipe and used dyeBlack.

Changes:
Clean up and add instanceof test for IMusic. Make SheetMusicUtil class and enum. Remove short-circuit logic in favor of clearer brace indentation.
Adjust recipes to use oredict names where possible.
Resolve clarinet recipe conflict with Quark vertical planks. Now uses 1 sugarcane and 2 plankWood. Changed the Flute recipe to use 2 sugarcane and 1 plankWood.
Minor changes to instrument right, left and shift-right click actions when equipped to the off-hand. Offhand playing is not supported at this time.

Changes:
Rework the Play Music chain to improve reliability and eliminate clicks and pops on abrupt cutoff.
Stop and resume vanilla background music when mxTune is playing. Limited streaming channels require this to prevent the background music from interrupting an mxTune play session.
Move ModSounds initialization during block registration. This ensures the mxTune SoundCategory and pcm_proxy sound event is setup before the sound system starts up.
Ensure client request MIDI status packet is only called from the effective server side. Remove ClientAudio#init method that was attempting to exercise the audio chain at the moment a player logs onto the game.
Add gradle project files to ease building for anyone who want to contribute.

New status HUD. New option on Music Options dialog to adjust the size the position of the HUD. It's a bit derpy right now. It needs more love.
New look for the group status placards for players.
No more PLAYING GUI for the PIANO. You will be able to chat while you play!
No more PLAYING GUI for JAM/GROUP Sessions! You CAN Walk and RUN while JAMMING - BUT...
... While JAMMING Music Will Stop if the DISTANCE between the JAMMERS goes beyond a set LIMIT!
All mxTune music will be 3D audio sound sources for LISTENERS. Music PLAYERS will hear other SOLOISTS and GROUPS in 3D, but will HEAR their OWN PLAYING in STEREO.
A new audio chain the pregenerates the audio and the then plays it. This allows the 3D effects and eliminates stutters that could occur in the old chain.
Removed the Volume Control from the mxTune Music Options Dialog and placed it on the Vanilla Music & Sound Options dialog. This means that mxTune music can be adjusted like any other sounds in Minecraft.

Known issues:
Starting to play may fail. Just retry. It may be related to accidentally bumping the mouse wheel/scroll while playing. Depends how sloppy/sensitive it is.

Notes:
I've left some logging turned on the group play and the PCM audio codec. You will see INFO lines in the log like this:
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 0
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 1
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 2

[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 6
...
[14:05:22] [Thread-10/INFO]: cleanup
These are buffers of dead silence that are generated while the audio chain converts the MML to audio. Depending on the speed of your CPU and load on your game and JAVA there may be more.If there are more than 40 per play, your PC is probably too slow to run mxTune properly. It's hard to tell though. I only have my own PC to test on. Please let me know. "cleanup" is posted for any error or the end a clean play. Not very helpful, I need to improve error messages for the audio chain.

FIXED:
Blacklist and Whitelist were lost when a player died or changed dimensions. They are now saved properly.

DROPPED:
No more support for Minecraft 1.9.4. I will concentrate on 1.10.2, 1.11+. A release for 1.11 will occur sometime in December.

Continued to work on the new MML->PCM 3D  audio chain. The Magic Music Item (Creative Item) is a test instrument that uses this new system. The volume control for this item is on the vanilla "Music & Sounds Options..." dialog.

Only changes you'll see are with the creative only "Magic Music Item." It now uses a new audio chain that allows playing music via the 3D sound system. It's currently a solo fixed voice only item. It features linear volume attenuation. So listeners will hear the sound within a 16 block radius and have the potential to hear the sound if they are present within a 24 block radius of the music source.

Correct MML "n#" issue where notes are played one octave too low. Closes Issue #6

Issue #6
It seems that when notes are played using the n# format, they're exactly one octave too low in-game.

Sample case:

MML@cn48cn48cn48cn48,;
All the notes played above should be the same, but in-game they're not.

Requests: Add a new hand held instrument. The "Music Box".

For the heck of it: Added an "Ocarina" and "Sawtooth Lead".

There is still a huge amount of work to do before I think about making this pretty and configurable so you are stuck with my ugly textures for now :D

Updated the Music Options dialog. Currently on the "P" keybind.

In multiplayer you can now create white and black lists to fine tune who you want to hear, or not. At the moment there must be other players online to populate the Players list.

Add a server side config option for allowing a player to walk and play music - Solo only using a hand held instrument. Set to True be default. Server owners should make sure to update the config file.

To stop playing simply switch items.

This is a first pass at doing this. There are some issues to be resolved.

Prevent a player from moving the active instrument in inventory while playing.
As of yet undiscovered issues or corner use cases. 
Setting this version to Beta so it appears in the Curse Client mod list. I think it's time to get some more opinions. This is still very much in early stages of development.

Added a new feature: MML Music Volume. Now available on the mxTune Music Options dialog accessible via the "P" key.

This feature is still under construction. The mute options have not been implemented at this time.

General code cleanup and refactoring. Moved "Play" initiation code from the client side to the server side and eliminated two network packets in the process.

Made a change to the Music Paper item. Currently this item can be music paper OR sheet music depending on an internal property. The problem with that is that when in sheet music form, it can still be stacked to 16 pieces as long as the name is the same. And there lies a problem since you could overwrite a tune with the same name. This also makes inventory operations and slot mechanics somewhat difficult. Ideally I want a single item stack in instrument inventory.

To solve this issue I have created a Sheet Music item with a max stack size of one. Converting the old sheet music to the new sheet music is easy. If the sheet music resides in an instrument inventory it will be automatically converted upon opening.

Old style sheet music now has a red border and note symbol. The new item sheet music uses the current green note. Both will still work in instruments. I have included an item to convert any existing sheet music items to the new sheet music items. See the creative tab. Simply place the old sheet music into player inventory then hold the Sheet Music Converter in your main hand and right click.

Updated the MML input dialog. Now parses MML and displays the errors in a list. Clicking on and error moves the cursor to the error in the editor. This is intended as a very simple editor to fix simple problems. As an added feature the the MML can be test played in the dialog. Only the player using the dialog will hear the music.

This jar will also work with 1.10.
