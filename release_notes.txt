2017-07-27: mxtune-1.11.2-0.4.0-dev.25
Fixes:
Issue #2 Extraneous input '&' after note length command: Now allows the tie of a tied note to exist before or after an interspersed command e.g. "c.&c16l64&c" or "c.&c16&l64c" 
Issue #17 "Musician Villager Entity Name": Added language key for the Musician Villager.
Issue #18 "Suggestion; MML@ & final ;": 
    Add a URL link to the "MML Simple Editor" dialog. URL is configurable. default URL is https://mabibeats.com/
    The "MML@" and ";" tokens in the MML entry dialog is now optional.

Changes:
Improved ArcheAge MML support. Now detects ArcheAge MML volume levels and "does the right thing".
Improved MML parsing by making it less strict. It will allow silly MML like accidentals on rests: e.g. "a&a&R+8.l16a" The "MML@" and ";" tokens in the MML entry dialog is optional. Allow rests in between tied notes. Rests will extend overall length of the tied as expected.
Added more localization string for GUIs.
Improved tool-tips on instruments and music paper.

Breakage:
Updated to latest the MCP mappings and in the process I broke placement of the piano. I did fix it, but if a piano looks weird break it and replace it. Sheet Music that may have been on on the piano is lost forever. Sorry.

Fixes:
Issue #16 "Crash on Music & Sounds Menu"; Remove the problematic ModSoundCategory class. It was a nice idea, but ultimately enums and reflection is a dicey thing. Especially in the world of Forge and Minecraft modding.

Changes:
The mxTune volume control has been removed from the vanilla "Music & Sounds" options menu. mxTune now uses the Players volume control.

2017-03-28: mxtune-1.10.2-0.4.0-dev.20, mxtune-1.11.2-0.4.0-dev.20
Note:
This release intended primarily to get feedback about the new soundfont and instruments.
Changes:
Added a soundfont (assets/mxtune/synth/mxtune.sf2). Now music on all clients will have same instruments/timbre. The soundfont is
modeled on Mabinogi instruments. This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS! This is NOT the final version of the soundfont.
Soundfont Goals:
1) Make the instruments sound as good as those in Mabinogi, but a little different.
2) Keep it small. It's currently about 10MB.
3) Add some additional instruments. For now harpsicord, coupled harpsicord, recorder, trumpet, standard percussion set, and orchestral percussion set.

Due to instrument changes, you are stuck with my cheap textures and limited json models. Some instruments like the harpsicord, cello,
and percussion sets will eventually become block instruments. That is they will need to be placed into the world to be used. Similar
to the piano. Recipes changed and updated to reflect the new soundfont.

Fixes:
Small improvements to starting and stopping play. Tunes should not stop in the middle of play anymore. Still more work to be done. I'm
aware of some threading and network data synchronization issues. Sections of code to be re-written.

Piano was dropping it's item in creative mode when broken. This has been corrected, but you will need break and re-place all pianos in
the world. Any enclosed sheet music is gone forever. Sorry, it had to be done.

Added support to the build for Travis CI and SonarCube. As a result many bugs and security vulnerabilities have been squashed.

Changes:
Turn off logging for the SoundSystem endOfStream events. On some systems this was causing the fml-client-latest logs to grow very large.
Troubleshoot and make some change to the ClientAudio classes thread use, and use of the synchronized specifier.
Poached ConfigureSound from Dynamic Surroundings and added configuration options for it. This allows using all of the available sound channels.

Adjust recipes to use oredict names where possible.
Resolve clarinet recipe conflict with Quark vertical planks. Now uses 1 sugarcane and 2 plankWood. Changed the Flute recipe to use 2 sugarcane and 1 plankWood.

Rework the Play Music chain to improve reliability and eliminate clicks and pops on abrupt cutoff.
Stop and resume vanilla background music when mxTune is playing. Limited streaming channels require this to prevent the background music from interrupting an mxTune play session.
Move ModSounds initialization during block registration. This ensures the mxTune SoundCategory and pcm_proxy sound event is setup before the sound system starts up.
Ensure client request MIDI status packet is only called from the effective server side. Remove ClientAudio#init method that was attempting to exercise the audio chain at the moment a player logs onto the game.

New status HUD. New option on Music Options dialog to adjust the size the position of the HUD. It's a bit derpy right now. It needs more love.
New look for the group status placards for players.
No more PLAYING GUI for the PIANO. You will be able to chat while you play!
No more PLAYING GUI for JAM/GROUP Sessions! You CAN Walk and RUN while JAMMING - BUT...
... While JAMMING Music Will Stop if the DISTANCE between the JAMMERS goes beyond a set LIMIT!
All mxTune music will be 3D audio sound sources for LISTENERS. Music PLAYERS will hear other SOLOISTS and GROUPS in 3D, but will HEAR their OWN PLAYING in STEREO.
A new audio chain the pregenerates the audio and the then plays it. This allows the 3D effects and eliminates stutters that could occur in the old chain.
Removed the Volume Control from the mxTune Music Options Dialog and placed it on the Vanilla Music & Sound Options dialog. This means that mxTune music can be adjusted like any other sounds in Minecraft.

Known issues:
Starting to play may fail. Just retry. It may be related to accidentally bumping the mouse wheel/scroll while playing. Depends how sloppy/sensitive it is.

Notes:
I've left some logging turned on the group play and the PCM audio codec. You will see INFO lines in the log like this:
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 0
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 1
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 2
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 3
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 4
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 5
[14:05:20] [Thread-11/INFO]:   zeroBufferCount: 6
...
[14:05:22] [Thread-10/INFO]: cleanup
These are buffers of dead silence that are generated while the audio chain converts the MML to audio. Depending on the speed of your CPU and load on your game and JAVA there may be more.If there are more than 40 per play, your PC is probably too slow to run mxTune properly. It's hard to tell though. I only have my own PC to test on. Please let me know. "cleanup" is posted for any error or the end a clean play. Not very helpful, I need to improve error messages for the audio chain.

FIXED:
Blacklist and Whitelist were lost when a player died or changed dimensions. They are now saved properly.

DROPPED:
No more support for Minecraft 1.9.4. I will concentrate on 1.10.2, 1.11+. A release for 1.11 will occur sometime in December.

Continued to work on the new MML->PCM 3D  audio chain. The Magic Music Item (Creative Item) is a test instrument that uses this new system. The volume control for this item is on the vanilla "Music & Sounds Options..." dialog.
----

2016-10-11: mxtune-1.10.2-0.3.1.0-dev.6, mxtune-1.9.4-0.3.1.0-dev.6
For Forge builds 1.10.2-12.18.1.2094+

Only changes you'll see are with the creative only "Magic Music Item." It now uses a new audio chain that allows playing music via the 3D sound system. It's currently a solo fixed voice only item. It features linear volume attenuation. So listeners will hear the sound within a 16 block radius and have the potential to hear the sound if they are present within a 24 block radius of the music source.

Correct MML "n#" issue where notes are played one octave too low. Closes Issue #6

Issue #6
It seems that when notes are played using the n# format, they're exactly one octave too low in-game.

Sample case:

MML@cn48cn48cn48cn48,;
All the notes played above should be the same, but in-game they're not.

Add a server side config option for allowing a player to walk and play music - Solo only using a hand held instrument. Set to True be default. Server owners should make sure to update the config file.

To stop playing simply switch items.

This is a first pass at doing this. There are some issues to be resolved.

Prevent a player from moving the active instrument in inventory while playing.
As of yet undiscovered issues or corner use cases. 
Setting this version to Beta so it appears in the Curse Client mod list. I think it's time to get some more opinions. This is still very much in early stages of development.

Added a new feature: MML Music Volume. Now available on the mxTune Music Options dialog accessible via the "P" key.

This feature is still under construction. The mute options have not been implemented at this time.

General code cleanup and refactoring. Moved "Play" initiation code from the client side to the server side and eliminated two network packets in the process.

Made a change to the Music Paper item. Currently this item can be music paper OR sheet music depending on an internal property. The problem with that is that when in sheet music form, it can still be stacked to 16 pieces as long as the name is the same. And there lies a problem since you could overwrite a tune with the same name. This also makes inventory operations and slot mechanics somewhat difficult. Ideally I want a single item stack in instrument inventory.

To solve this issue I have created a Sheet Music item with a max stack size of one. Converting the old sheet music to the new sheet music is easy. If the sheet music resides in an instrument inventory it will be automatically converted upon opening.

Old style sheet music now has a red border and note symbol. The new item sheet music uses the current green note. Both will still work in instruments. I have included an item to convert any existing sheet music items to the new sheet music items. See the creative tab. Simply place the old sheet music into player inventory then hold the Sheet Music Converter in your main hand and right click.

Updated the MML input dialog. Now parses MML and displays the errors in a list. Clicking on and error moves the cursor to the error in the editor. This is intended as a very simple editor to fix simple problems. As an added feature the the MML can be test played in the dialog. Only the player using the dialog will hear the music.

This jar will also work with 1.10.
